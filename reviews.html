			<h2>Bobby Brown</h2>
			<p>This dentist was one of the best places I've ever been to!!! All of the staff are super nice and make sure that you are accomodated correctly. Opened on time and even left a little late for me. They work fast and professional, I felt no pain when getting my dentures replaced and will definatley be coming back again!</p>
			<h2>Jessica Jones</h2>
			<p>This was my first time at this office. Did not know what to expect, was very pleasantly surprised. Clean neat and tidy professional dental office, with very friendly efficient knowledgeable staff!!! Everything was done on tightly manner and the office manager explained options clearly. There was no pressure sales and I would recommend this dental office to anyone.</p> 
			<h2>Harry Harolds</h2>
			<p>The staff was so nice and amazing!!! They waited for me even though they were closing because I was late and they got me in an out in no time! What I really love about this dentist is they're honesty to let me know everything that needs to get done and they sat me down and told me how much it would cost prior to doing it. I really appreciated this because most dentist just do the work and tell you the price later. I also liked the fact that I didn't have to pay all of it up front they worked with me and let me pay it month. I already recommended two of my friends here and I would really recommend anyone!! This is my forever dentist!!!!</p>
